Oracle is the chosen database in the system and JDBC is applied to connect Oracle. 
There are three types of users in my system, they are buyers (who want to buy a new or used car), dealers and owners who own the cars.
For the buyers, they can use many functions provided by our system to find a car he interested in. These functions for the buyers include refined search, save cars, compare cars, get recommended cars and review and rate the cars and dealers. Also, the system can tell them the hottest car models and best sellers. For the owners and dealers, they can put the cars they have on the sell list in our system. If one buyer select a car in our system, the seller will be announced and finished the transaction. Also, there is a function called get a quota for the sellers.This function has an algorithm that can help the seller calculate an estimate price about a car if some properties and parameters of the car provided. Whatâ€™s more, the system provides a total sale report and trend analysis report for the dealers. The trend analysis includes which model sells best and which area that most buyers from etc. In our database, we created about 10 tables and 10 thousands tuples altogether.
